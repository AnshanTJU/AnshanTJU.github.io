Dr. Shan An received a Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering from Tianjin University, China in 2007 and a Master's degree in Control Science from Shandong University, China, in 2010. He received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Beihang University in 2022. He currently leads the computer vision and signal processing directions at JD Health. He is an IET Fellow and a BCS Fellow. He is also a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM. He has authored or co-authored more than 40 papers in journals and conferences. He has more than 30 patents granted in China and 8 patents granted in the United States, Japan and Russia. He has served as a program committee member for ACM Multimedia (2019-2022), AAAI (2022-2023), and IJCAI (2021-2022). He is a reviewer of more than twenty highly prestigious journals and conference papers, such as TMI, TMM, TNNLS, PR, RAL, ICRA, IROS etc. His main research interests are extended reality and robotics.

Current Research Interests
======
His main research interests are concentrated in two cutting-edge technological areas: Extended Reality (XR) and robotics. Extended Reality encompasses Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR), which are dedicated to creating immersive user experiences and have a wide range of applications across industries such as gaming, education, healthcare, and design. In the field of robotics, Dr. An's research might cover various aspects from fundamental robot design and motion control algorithms to advanced artificial intelligence integration, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. Through in-depth research in these areas, Dr. An is committed to advancing the development of intelligent systems to achieve a more intelligent and automated future.
