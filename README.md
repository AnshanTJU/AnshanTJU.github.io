## Shan An's personal webpage (安山)

I am working as an algorithm expert at JD.com. Previously, I worked for the China Academy of Space Technology and Alibaba.
In 2007 I graduated from Tianjin University. In 2010 I received a Master’s Degree in Control Science from Shandong University. 

My research interests include Computer Vision and large-scale image retrieval. I have ten years of experience in these fields.
I have applied for twenty-five patents, including image retrieval, image processing, computer vision and two patents have been issued.

During the time I worked at TaoBao and JD, I was responsible for more than twenty computer vision projects. For example, image retrieval for near duplicate product image detection, three Dimension-like product image generation for multi-view product displays and using product images to generate video. I was awarded as an Excellent Mentor at JD in 2017 and 2018.
